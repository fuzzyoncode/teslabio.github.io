	<h2>FAQ</h2>

<button class="accordion">What is Life Force Energy?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Life Force Energy is the essential vital force of nature believed to be the healing energy for all life. Our cellular structures interact with Life Force Energy every day, but most people do not have the level of exposure to this powerful, naturally therapeutic energy in order to facilitate optimal cellular function. Tesla BioHealing has integrated Nikola Tesla's inventions for harnessing this healing energy and converged his unparalleled discoveries with modern-day applications in medical science.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">How can Life Force Energy help me be healthier?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Life Force Energy has many known health benefits shown at the molecular, subcellular, cellular, organ, and whole-body levels. Life Force Energy has been shown to recharge and jumpstart cellular self-repair, increase the energy potential of cells in the body, cleanse the blood and promote circulation, and improve immune function by as much as 149%. It has also been shown to improve mental clarity, act as a natural antidepressant, regulate blood pressure and blood sugar levels, improve quality of sleep, and reduce inflammation throughout the body drastically reducing pain, among other health benefits.
	<hr>
	All of the body's systems need Life Force Energy as a driving force in order to promote optimal biological function. Although Life Force Energy occurs naturally in the atmosphere and is already being utilized on a cellular level, the concentration is usually not strong enough to deliver a powerful therapeutic effect as may be required for your specific health condition. Tesla BioHealing products generate concentrated amounts of Life Force Energy, which can be used to further activate your body's innate healing capacity and improve quality of life.
	</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">How can the effects of Tesla BioHealing products be measured?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Like most pharmaceutical products, the effects of Tesla BioHealing OTC Medical Devices are measured by the user's safety and health improvements after product use. From what we observed in 10,000+ users, Tesla BioHealing products are very safe and very effective since we are generating natural Life Force Energy, which has been known to profoundly support the activation of cellular self-repair.
	  <hr>
	  The early signs of efficacy after using Tesla BioHealing products include, but are not limited to: (1) More restful sleep; (2) Vivid dreams (indicating enhanced brain activity); (3) Increased energy; (4) Libido increase, (5) Improved digestion, (6) Reduction in brain fog, (7) Pain reduction, (8) Normalized blood glucose; (9) Normalized blood pressure, etc. Other improvements were measured based on individual users and their specific conditions.
	  According to the FDA, safety and efficacy are the gold standard for any healthcare solution, and Tesla BioHealing products have certainly met the goal for providing a safe, natural, and powerfully effective health solution to those in need. People who utilize our technology are experiencing remarkable improvements in their health every day.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Is there a risk of over-exposure to Life Force Energy? Can I “overcharge” my body?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>No. Life Force Energy exists naturally in the environment and is constantly interacting with your body on a cellular level. Our devices are simply creating a higher density of Life Force Energy in your home environment so that your cellular structures can naturally uptake whatever is required to reach optimal function. You can think about entering the concentrated field of Life Force Energy generated by our devices, much like traveling from a polluted city to an oxygen rich mountain range. Just because your body is now in an environment with all the oxygen needed for optimal health does not mean it will over-oxygenate if you decide to spend as much time there as possible. Your cells naturally regulate the uptake of Life Force Energy and will only absorb as much as is needed for optimal function.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Who invented Tesla BioHealing technology?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Inspired by the work of Nikola Tesla, James Z. Liu, MD, Ph.D., and colleagues invented this new technology and founded Tesla BioHealing, Inc. in order to provide the world with breakthrough, natural, non-invasive, and very effective Life Force Energy medical devices.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What are the typical phases of recovery while using Tesla BioHealing technology?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Based upon trends that we have seen in the 10,000+ people using our OTC medical devices safely and effectively, the following phases of recovery in wellbeing have been known to take place: Recharge, Targeted Cellular Repair & Health Maintenance. <hr> 
	The cells of the body are able to recharge themselves due to increased levels of Life Force Energy available in the environment provided by Tesla BioHealing medical devices. This leads to early signs of efficacy due to the cells having enough energy to start functioning more optimally. Early signs of efficacy typically occur within the first few days or weeks of use and can include but are not limited to: (1) Pain reduction; (2) Better sleep; (3) Vivid dreams (indicating enhanced brain activity); (4) Increased energy; (5) Libido increase, (6) Improved digestion; (7) Easier breathing, (8) Increased mental clarity, (9) normalized blood glucose; (10) normalized blood pressure, etc.
	<hr>
	Phase 1: Recharge
	
	The cells of the body are able to recharge themselves due to increased levels of Life Force Energy available in the environment provided by Tesla BioHealing medical devices. This leads to early signs of efficacy due to the cells having enough energy to start functioning more optimally. Early signs of efficacy typically occur within the first few days or weeks of use, and can include but are not limited to: (1) pain reduction; (2) better sleep; (3) vivid dreams, indicating enhanced brain activity; (4) fresh energy; (5) libido increase, (6) easy bowel movement; (7) easier breathing, (8) mental clarity, (9) normalized blood glucose; (10) normalized blood pressure, etc.
	In the recharge phase, cells will uptake as much of the Life Force Energy as they need from the amount that is available. This initial utilization of increased levels of Life Force Energy empowers the cells to start activating their self-healing mechanisms. The recharge phase typically occurs very quickly, and people begin to notice that they are feeling better soon after they start to use Tesla BioHealing technology as their cells absorb more and more of this healing Life Force Energy.
	At this initial phase, people may even feel well enough to ask, “Do I need to keep using the device?” We recommend continued use of Tesla BioHealing products to ensure that your body has had enough time to enter the repair phase, which comes after the recharge phase.
	<hr>
	Phase 2: Targeted Cellular Repair 

	Once the system is sufficiently recharged, the cells can begin their repair phase. In the repair phase of recovery not only are the cells able to become energized for optimal functioning, but they are also able to be repaired and restructured in order to stabilize you into a new state of wellbeing.
	The repair phase is targeted in various parts of the system by the body’s own innate intelligence depending upon where the most amount of healing is needed. The more Life Force Energy available, the more repair throughout the body that the cells are able to activate concurrently. Cellular repair in various parts of the body begins to activate once the cellular tissue has absorbed enough Life Force Energy to begin repairing and restructuring in order to allow the body to reach a new level of health, even beyond the improvements experienced in the initial recharge phase.
	The repair phase may not seem as dramatic an improvement as the recharge phase because by the time a repair phase is initiated the person benefitting from the Life Force Energy has already experienced wellbeing improvements and started to become used to feeling better than they did when they initially started using Tesla BioHealing technology. During the recharge phase, the body is quickly brought up to a high level of Life Force Energy to address the immediate needs in the most needed areas (damaged organ/tissues/cells), the most people are able to “tell” or “physically notice” a significant improvement during this drastic jump to a new level of wellbeing.
	When the body progresses to a repair-rebuilding stage, the progress may not be as fast or as notable as was in the beginning, but repair is taking place nonetheless to not only support the experience of breakthrough health outcomes but also to ensure that new level of wellbeing becomes the norm for you. It does not take a long time for your cells to re-energize, but it does take a longer time for them to repair. The actual self-repair and restructuring mechanisms of the cells take significant amounts of Life Force Energy to ensue and carry through to completion. If you would like a more dramatic effect from the repair phase you may do so by introducing more Life Force Energy to your system by using additional Tesla BioHealing medical devices.
	How long this repair phase will take varies by individual, each person is different. It greatly depends on how depleted and damaged someone’s cellular system was before using Tesla BioHealing technology, and how much Life Force Energy is available to address their health conditions adequately. The more severe and crippling a condition, the more Life Force Energy is needed to address it properly, which is why we offer both the Tesla BioHealers, and the MedBed Generators to provide varying degrees of Life Force Energy for each individual user. We recommend continued use of the product even after you start feeling better to make sure that your cellular health reaches a state of optimal functioning and stability with this new Life Force Energy technology.
	<hr>
	Phase 3 – Health Maintenance & Continuous Cellular Support
	
	Once the repair phase has allowed the body to recover to a great extent and stabilize in a new state of wellbeing, the maintenance phase can begin. Since Tesla BioHealing is so easy to use and does not require any change to your lifestyle, we recommend keeping the technology as an asset to your overall wellbeing even after reaching a consistent state of health. Life Force Energy can be an important factor that slows down your aging process, as well as provide many other long term health benefits. Cellular support is very important throughout life and the Life Force Energy generated by Tesla BioHealing medical devices offers an easy way to provide your body with the optimal environment for continued vitality and wellness.
	Once cells have been recharged and the cellular tissue repaired, increased levels of energy, significant pain relief, and overall health improvements begin to become more and more remarkable. When the cells gain further energy, a deeper level of cellular recharge and repair may take place to further strengthen the body. If this occurs, the body’s cells will become even more optimized, thus continuously continuing the cycle of healing, as the body’s innate intelligence continues to use the Life Force Energy available to scan your system on an ongoing basis for any cellular repair that needs to take place.</p>
</div>


<button class="accordion">How is Tesla BioHealing technology different from other energy-based therapies and scalar wave devices?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Tesla BioHealers and Tesla MedBed Generators are FDA registered Over-the-Counter (OTC) medical devices. Our company is completely data driven, and we have gone to great lengths to clinically verify the safety and efficacy of our products before introducing them to the market.
	Tesla BioHealing OTC medical devices create an environment of highly concentrated Life Force Energy that the cells of the body can use at will. A field of pure Life Force Energy is generated, which does not need to be forced through the body via any type of frequency programming or vibratory mechanism. This allows the body’s innate intelligence to be in charge of the self-healing process, facilitating profound and rapid improvements in wellbeing, even in unexpected ways since there is always more going on within the intricacy of our cellular systems than current medical science can comprehend. The cellular structures of the body already know how to interact with Life Force Energy, and when they have enough Life Force Energy available, they are able to uptake it naturally and activate their own self-repair mechanisms in order to begin functioning optimally. We rely on the body’s innate organizing intelligence to prioritize the utilization of Life Force Energy how your cells see fit versus sending specific frequencies through the body at specific times.
	Furthermore, because there are no magnets or electricity involved in the generation of this Life Force Energy field, our medical devices are perfectly safe for anyone with a pacemaker or any kind of medical implant and has even been known to enhance the benefits of those undergoing other forms of energy therapies or traditional medicine treatment courses.
	Although a Nikola Tesla inspired technology, Tesla BioHealing OTC Medical Devices harness Life Force Energy in a completely unique way than what is typically understood in regard to scalar waves. In fact, the way in which this Life Force Energy is generated is a technological and medical breakthrough, not requiring any electricity to achieve. These devices act independently of any mechanical or electrical energy source, therefore offering a safe and natural solution unlike any other. In addition to being a safe and pure source of Life Force Energy, many experts in the field of energy medicine have stated that our medical devices provide the most profound wellbeing enhancement that they have experienced among the energy-based medicine products available today. </p>

<h2>Our Products</h2>

<button class="accordion">What are the early signs of effectiveness, and how soon will I experience results?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The early signs of the efficacy after using Tesla BioHealing products include but are not limited to: (1) more restful sleep; (2) vivid dreams (indicating enhanced brain activity); (3) increased energy; (4) increased libido; (5) improved bowel movement; (6) clear mind, (7) pain reduction, (8) normalized blood glucose; (9) normalized blood pressure and more.
	The length of time needed to note benefits varies depending upon the condition and the amount of Life Force Energy available to the user. Some people notice improvements in as little as 30 minutes, while others may need several days to start experiencing positive effects. A patient with severe COPD improved her breathing only 5 minutes after using a Tesla BioHealer! For relieving pain from migraines or headaches, the effect can be very quick. For hip or joint damage, paralysis due to stroke, or cancer, a longer length of time is needed to experience significant effects. The more Life Force Energy, the shorter the length of time required for effectiveness to occur.  Age is also a factor as younger people tend to experience the benefits more quickly, and older adults need more time for their bodies to start showing health improvements. For most people, the early signs of efficacy can be experienced after only one to three days of using Tesla BioHealing products, and significant health improvements typically start to take place within the first two months.

</div>

<button class="accordion">What is the difference between Tesla BioHealers and the Tesla MedBed Generators?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Tesla BioHealers are portable devices that generate a field of pure Life Force Energy, offering a powerful and practical health solution for those in need. Tesla BioHealers are recommended for people with mild to moderate conditions and diseases but can be compounded to address more severe situations. Using multiple Tesla BioHealers in conjunction with one another amplifies the Life Force Energy field, offering a more powerful solution for people who would benefit from even more cellular support.
	  <br><hr>
	Tesla MedBed Generators provide a field of pure Life Force Energy over 100x more powerful than Tesla BioHealers. Tesla MedBed Generators offer an unparalleled health solution for those seeking even more accelerated and enhanced outcomes. Tesla MedBed Generators are recommended for people with serious conditions and diseases who seek very fast and profound therapeutic improvement. 2 Tesla MedBed Generators = 200 Tesla BioHealers in terms of Life Force Energy output. 4 Tesla MedBed Generators = 400 Tesla BioHealers, etc.
	<br>
	Both Tesla BioHealers and Tesla MedBed Generators are FDA Registered OTC Medical Devices.

<button class="accordion">How does the BioHealer for Pets help animals? Is it safe for my pet to sleep with me if I have Adult BioHealers or the MedBed Generators?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The known benefits of Life Force Energy for humans have also been noted for animals. Life Force Energy can nourish your pet's cells the same way as occurs for providing cellular support to the human body. Owners who used our BioHealers for Pets told us that their beloved animals with various medical conditions regained energy, were in less pain, had shinier coats, and even that old dogs started behaving like puppies again!<hr>
	It is interesting to note how sensitive animals are to Life Force Energy. You may notice that after getting a BioHealer or MedBed Generators for yourself that your pets will want to be around the devices all the time. This is perfectly fine, even if the device is for adults and not for pets specifically. There is no risk for over-exposure to this naturally occurring energy. We have created BioHealers for pets and children specifically because their bodies require less Life Force Energy to support their cells than adults do. However, if your pets have a very high concentration of Life Force Energy available in their environment, their cells will only absorb what is needed without risk of overcharging their bodies. Life Force Energy is a safe, naturally occurring, healing vital force of nature that has been proven to be beneficial for the optimal functioning of all living cells, including the cellular structure of animals. Pets are often naturally drawn to our devices. This Life Force Energy is safe for them and has been shown to be very beneficial for pets' wellbeing whether you are using the Tesla BioHealers or MedBed Generators. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Will the Life Force Energy diminish if a device is shared by multiple people or a pet instead of it being used by one person only?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>No, Tesla BioHealing products generate a continuous 3D field of Life Force Energy. Anyone within this concentrated field of Life Force Energy will be able to benefit. However, the closer someone is to the unit, the stronger the Life Force Energy will be. Therefore, we recommend each individual to invest in their own product(s) based upon their specific needs so that they can put the device as close to the affected area(s) as possible for optimal result</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What is the difference between a Tesla MedBed© and other medical bed technologies?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Tesla BioHealing offers medical devices that generate a field of pure Life Force Energy. Our most powerful health solution is the Tesla MedBed which is created by placing our MedBed Generators underneath your existing bed frame. The Tesla MedBed Generators offer an optimal environment that nourishes the body at the cellular level. These medical devices have been providing breakthroughs for many people with a variety of chronic unmet needs. Although there may be other medical bed technologies coming in the future, our technology is available now, backed by safety and efficacy studies, and registered with the FDA as an OTC medical device. Over 10,000 people have improved their life quality by using Tesla BioHealing technology and we look forward to helping many more to come.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">How long do Tesla BioHealing OTC medical devices last?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>All Tesla BioHealing products come preactivated and are guaranteed to constantly generate a field of pure Life Force Energy for at least 3 years. If the shelf life is extended beyond 3 years, there will be an update to our website notifying our customers of the extension due to further data collection.
	  <hr>
	The 3-year shelf life is only a timeline point based on the current measurements as we are a data driven, science-based company. Currently, we have energy output stability data to support a 3-year shelf life, with no decrease in energy output being noted in any product line. However, we are still in the process of collecting the stability data. At the end of 3 years from the date the product was manufactured (shortly before you purchased the device), the shelf-life may be stretched out to a much longer period.  We simply need more time to collect the energy output data to measure ongoing stability beyond the current three-year point and then inform the public about the longer shelf life.
	Our technology is aimed at helping you regain your freedom and enhance your overall health. It is not our intention that you would need to purchase a new device after 3 years, as your health conditions and overall quality of life should be significantly improved long before the three-year mark. Early signs of efficacy are often noted within the first few weeks of use, and significant health improvements can take place even within the first few months of utilizing the technology if you have had enough Life Force Energy available to address your specific needs. To learn more about which product(s) may be best for you, please review our Device Use Recommendation Table.<hr>
	Using our technology even after you achieve improvements in your health would be beneficial in order to continuously offer your body cellular support. As we continue to utilize the technology successfully over longer periods of time, we believe we will be able to continue extending the shelf-life due to the nature in which our technology is able to generate this highly beneficial field of pure Life Force Energy.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What is the cost justification of this technology if Life Force Energy is naturally occurring?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Tesla BioHealers and Tesla MedBed Generators are FDA Registered Over-the-Counter Medical Devices with an overwhelmingly satisfactory outcome from more than 10,000 user’s feedback. Our devices deliver a pure and very strong Life Force Energy field for systematic healing. In other words, these devices have the ability to address many different health conditions of the user at once versus being limited to the conventional specific pathway reaction of a single health condition approach.<hr>
	Harnessing the Forces of Nature to the Service of Mankind
	Simply because a substance is naturally occurring in the environment doesn’t mean that it is inexpensive to manufacture technology for its useful application. In fact, “harnessing the forces of nature to the service of mankind,” as Nikola Tesla puts so aptly, is often a very costly process. For example, solar energy is “free energy” that we all benefit from every day, but the solar panels used to harness this power is not inexpensive to produce or purchase. Similar to solar panel technology being ultimately more cost effective because of money saved on typical electric bills, Tesla BioHealing technology has also saved many people thousands upon thousands of dollars in medical procedures and medication in addition to assisting them in not only managing their health conditions but actually reversing their condition and reclaiming their quality of life.</p>

<div class="panel">
  <p>Tesla BioHealing OTC Medical Devices are Registered with the US FDA and have been proven to be safe and effective. Before our technology was released to the public, we conducted extensive safety and efficacy studies which proved the devices to be safe to use and effective in addressing many different types of health conditions. Third party on-site monitoring and testing of the devices were conducted as well. These product tests concluded that there was no radioactivity in our raw materials, no harmful substances were released during production, and no radioactivity or harmful substances of any kind were present on, within, or released from the finished products.<hr>
	All Tesla BioHealing products are manufactured following the FDA’s current Good Manufacture Practice (cGMP). Our manufacturing operation is also in compliance and accordance with the Delaware Radiation Control Regulations (DRCR).<hr>
	The Life Force Energy provided by Tesla BioHealing technology is the same vital force of nature that the cells of your body are already utilizing every day for wellbeing. The Life Force Energy is safe and naturally occurring in the environment. Similar to when oxygen needs to be used therapeutically, Life Force Energy also needs to be provided in a concentrated form for the cells to uptake as much as they need as quickly as possible for optimal health benefits.</p>

<h2>Conditions & Efficacy</h2>

<button class="accordion">Can Tesla BioHealing products help with my specific condition?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Over 10,000 people to date have experienced remarkable improvements in a wide variety of health conditions by using Tesla BioHealing products. The Life Force Energy generated from these devices supports the body's natural ability to self-heal. Due to the fact that the cells are able to be nourished with the energy they need to thrive, many wellbeing improvements can take place throughout the body because cellular health is the key to all health. If your cells are healthy, the rest of your body can become healthier as well. <hr>
	Due to the fact that we are creating an environment for your cell's own innate intelligence to utilize the Life Force Energy optimally, we can never guarantee a specific outcome for any individual, because everyone's body will prioritize repair processes on the cellular level as is necessary based upon what they need in any given moment. The body knows much better what is needed for healing to take place than science has yet to uncover, and since we are supporting the body's incredible intelligence, the overwhelming majority of people using our technology have experienced fantastic results. </p>

<button class="accordion">Why do different conditions need to be addressed with different levels of Life Force Energy?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
	The more severe the condition, the more Life Force Energy is needed to adequately support cellular health. Likewise, the longer you have been suffering from a condition and the more damage that has occurred as a result, the more Life Force Energy will be needed to recharge and repair your cellular tissue. Someone with cancer needs much more cellular support than someone experiencing general fatigue. Likewise, someone with dementia would need much more Life Force Energy to help repair and regenerate brain tissue than someone would need who suffers from insomnia. Multiple Tesla BioHealers or MedBed Generators can be used to increase the amount of Life Force Energy that your cells have available to utilize.<hr>
Someone with hypertension may feel a sense of calm having a BioHealer near them for an hour, but if they sleep with a unit near them, a significant amount of stress on the body can be reduced, and they could start to see their blood pressure become normalized. People with arthritis or pain due to damaged discs could feel less pain using a BioHealer due to better circulation, but if they had 4 BioHealers, their tissue could rapidly start experiencing repair. Stroke patients could have more mobility and organized thought processes using 4 BioHealers, but with 2 MedBed Generators could improve brainpower and muscle strength more powerfully and experience a much faster return of normal functioning. People with cancer could experience a reduction in pain and relief from chemotherapy side effects with 4 or more BioHealers and could experience remarkable cellular normalization with 2 or more MedBed Generators.

<button class="accordion">How is Life Force Energy generated from these devices?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
	The Life Force Energy provided by Tesla BioHealing technology is generated utilizing natural, preactivated materials via a proprietary process based on a deep understanding of biology, physics, and chemistry. In essence, these medical devices act as an independent and powerful natural healing energy source without the need for electricity and are able to create their own environment of highly concentrated pure Life Force Energy much stronger than what would be found even in the healthiest places on earth. Providing your cells with a highly concentrated amount of Life Force Energy allows them to absorb as much as they need in order to activate your cellular self-repair and accelerate healing. There is no electricity or magnets involved in the generation of this pure energy field, which is a breakthrough in modern medicine, taking Nikola Tesla’s original discoveries even further by providing a health solution that is completely safe to use, even for those with medical implants such as pacemakers, or those using other forms of medical equipment for their wellbeing. The Life Force Energy provided by our medical devices is the same vital force of nature that all living cells already produce and use as an essential healing mechanism, but with our products, we are offering much more Life Force Energy than your body is able to produce on its own or than what is naturally occurring in the environment. By using these devices, you are entering into a new environment created specifically for supporting the cells optimally in order to enhance the body's self-healing capacities naturally and effectively.
